ObjectListView is licensed under GPLv3, however this conflicts 3ds Max licensing as it is closed source.
I have chosen, and want to license NLM under the much looser MIT license, and disagree with viral licenses.
It seems to be a very hipocritical licensing model. Open souce should be open, and not force others to use
others opinions, and licenses. That in itself is not open.
